      <h4>Project source</h4>
      <p>Clay is open source and hosted on GitHub. Every form of
      feedback, pull requests or other participation is more than
      welcome. CSS is a big standard containing lots of official and
      probably even more experimental style properties. Clay's support
      for all those properties is most likely incomplete. Adding new
      properties is easy so let me know if things should be added.</p>

      <h4>Website source</h4>
      <p>Of course, the style sheet of this website is also implemented
      in Clay. You can find the sources in the project source
      repository on GitHub. Feel free to use this page as template for
      your own projects.</p>
