    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <p>
      Clay is written in Haskell and requires the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
      (GHC) to get installed. After installing GHC, and the accompanying
      package manager Cabal, you can directly install Clay from the Hackage
      package repository:
    </p>
    <div class="code shell">
    <pre><span class=Symbol>$</span> cabal update
<span class=Symbol>$</span> cabal install clay</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      When you don't have GHC installed yet, it's probably best to install the
      Haskell Platform. The platform includes GHC and a basic set of Haskell
      tools and libraries, including Cabal. After installing the platform you
      can install Clay using cabal install.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
      Clay is written as an embedded language and requires you to write a
      Haskell program that models the stylesheet. You only need to import the
      <code>Clay</code> module to get started. As a first demonstration we
      create the `Hello world' of the stylesheets, a style definition that sets
      the background color of the HTML body to red.

    <div class="code haskell">
      <!--#include virtual=../highlighted/usage.clay.hs.html -->
    </div>
    <p>
      Running the <code>putCss</code> function directly outputs the generated
      CSS to the standard output resulting in:
    </p>
    <div class="code css">
      <!--#include virtual=../highlighted/usage.clay.hs.output.html -->
    </div>
  </div>
