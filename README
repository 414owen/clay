Clay is a CSS preprocessor like LESS and Sass, but implemented as an embedded
domain specific language (EDSL) in Haskell. This means that all CSS selectors
and style rules are first class Haskell functions, which makes reuse and
composability easy.

The project is described on http://fvisser.nl/clay.

The API documentation can be found in the top level module "Clay".
